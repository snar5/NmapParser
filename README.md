My first work with python nmap parser, which is probably equivalent to the a 
'hello world' program. Oddly, I keep needing/adding to it as I have found it to 
suite my needs. I still like the idea of command prompt to stay and work with data object without 
re-running commands. 

*Note lists only "OPEN" ports 

Package files
      sample.xml    a sample XML file to test with
      colors.py     a simple colors class
      nmapsort.py   the parser engine
      nmapparser.py this file

## USAGE: ##
      python nmapparser.py sample.xml
